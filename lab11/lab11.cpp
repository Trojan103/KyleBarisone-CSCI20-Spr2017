/* 1) Create a program so that the computer picks a random number (x) ranging 
from 0 to 20. 

2) Make the computer display every number on the screen from 0 to 20 in 
their own seperate box. 

3) The numbers listed above must be in numerical order starting 
from 0 and ending at 20. 

4) If the user clicks on the correct number, Theuser wins and a message displays
saying "congratulations!". 

5) If the incorrect number is guessed by the user, a notification pops up saying 
whether the number that was clicked is higher or lower than the number chosen
by the random number generator in step one.

6) If the random number is greater than the number chosen by the user, all 
numbers that are less than the number chosen by the user are eliminated and no 
longer show up on the screen.

7) If the random number is less than the number chosen by the user, all numbers
that are greater than the number chosen by the user are eliminated and no 
longer show up on the screen.

8) Repeat steps 6 and 7 until the correct number is clicked on by the user,
prompting the congratulations! screen to appear. */
