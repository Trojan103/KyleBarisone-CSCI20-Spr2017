 This program uses 4 total files. This main file is used to comparte the answers from answers.txt to the student's answers in studentAnswers.txt. It also keeps
 track of the student score based on the amount he or she gets wrong and or omits. After the answers are compared it outputs the grade to grade.txt and tells the students name as 
 well as what questions he or she missed as well as the total score.
